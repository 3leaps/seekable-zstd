# Agentic Attribution Standard

> Simplified from [FulmenHQ Crucible](https://github.com/fulmenhq/crucible) agentic attribution standard.

This document defines how AI-assisted contributions are attributed in seekable-zstd commits for traceability and accountability.

---

## Purpose

Agentic attribution enables:

1. **Traceability**: Identify which model/interface produced specific code
2. **Debugging**: Correlate issues with generation context
3. **Accountability**: Maintain human supervision records
4. **Analysis**: Track AI contribution patterns over time

---

## Design Philosophy

Unlike complex attribution systems with unique agent identities, personas, and emojis, this standard focuses on **two key dimensions**:

| Dimension     | What it captures                                | Why it matters                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**     | The AI model (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) | Different models have different capabilities/quirks |
| **Interface** | The tool used (e.g., `Claude Code`, `Cursor`)   | Interface affects prompting, context, tool access   |

This is sufficient for debugging and analysis without requiring identity infrastructure.

## Attribution Format

### Commit Message Structure

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body - detailed explanation>

<changes list>

Generated by <model> via <interface>
Supervised by: <human>

Co-Authored-By: <interface> <model> <noreply@3leaps.net>
```

### Components

#### Type (conventional commit)

| Type       | Usage                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature             |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                 |
| `docs`     | Documentation           |
| `test`     | Tests                   |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring        |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement |
| `chore`    | Maintenance             |

#### Scope (optional)

Component affected: `core`, `go`, `python`, `nodejs`, `ffi`, `docs`

#### Model Identifier

Use the exact model identifier when known:

| Provider  | Format                       | Examples                                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Anthropic | `claude-{variant}-{version}` | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `claude-opus-4-20250514` |
| OpenAI    | `gpt-{version}`              | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`                              |
| Other     | Provider's identifier        | `gemini-pro`, `llama-3-70b`                          |

If exact version unknown, use the general model name (e.g., `claude-3.5-sonnet`).

#### Interface Identifier

| Interface      | Identifier                  | Notes                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | `Claude Code`               | Anthropic CLI                   |
| OpenCode       | `OpenCode`                  | Open-source terminal interface  |
| Kilo Code      | `Kilo Code`                 | VS Code extension               |
| Cline          | `Cline`                     | VS Code extension               |
| Cursor         | `Cursor`                    | IDE with AI integration         |
| Aider          | `Aider`                     | Terminal-based pair programming |
| Windsurf       | `Windsurf`                  | Codeium IDE                     |
| Continue       | `Continue`                  | IDE extension                   |
| GitHub Copilot | `GitHub Copilot`            | GitHub's AI assistant           |
| Custom/API     | `API` or specific tool name | Direct API usage                |

#### Human Supervisor

GitHub handle of the supervising maintainer: `@username`

#### Co-Author Email

**Always use**: `noreply@3leaps.net`

This unified email domain:

- Avoids spamming provider noreply addresses (anthropic.com, openai.com)
- Provides consistent attribution across all AI providers
- Routes any accidental emails to a controlled destination

---

## Examples

### Feature Implementation

```
feat(core): add seekable encoder with configurable frame size

Implement Encoder struct wrapping zeekstd with configurable
frame size and compression level. Default frame size is 256KB
which balances seek granularity with compression ratio.

Changes:
- Add Encoder struct in encoder.rs
- Implement new(), with_frame_size(), with_level() constructors
- Add write() and finish() methods
- Unit tests for roundtrip compression

### Bug Fix

```
fix(python): handle empty byte ranges correctly

Empty ranges (start == end) were causing index errors in
the parallel decoder. Now returns empty bytes as expected.

Changes:
- Add bounds check in read_range()
- Return empty bytes for zero-length ranges
- Add test for edge case

### Documentation

```
docs: add parallel decompression guide

Explain how ParallelDecoder works, when to use it,
and expected speedup characteristics.

### Multi-Model Collaboration

When multiple models contribute (e.g., different sessions):

```
feat(go): implement CGO bindings

Add Go bindings via CGO wrapping the C FFI layer.
Includes Reader struct with Open, ReadRange, Close methods.

Changes:
- Add seekable.go with CGO wrapper
- Add seekable_test.go with test suite
- Include header file in include/

## Git Log Filtering

Query AI contributions by pattern:

```bash
# All AI-assisted commits
git log --grep="Generated by"

# Specific model
git log --grep="claude-sonnet-4"

# Specific interface
git log --grep="via Claude Code"

# Specific supervisor
git log --grep="Supervised by: @3leapsdave"

# Anthropic models
git log --grep="noreply@anthropic.com"
```

## Comparison with Complex Attribution

| Aspect              | Complex (FulmenHQ)         | Simple (seekable-zstd)      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Agent identity      | Named personas with emojis | Model + Interface only      |
| Email domain        | `noreply@3leaps.net`       | `noreply@3leaps.net` (same) |
| MAINTAINERS.md      | Required agent definitions | Not required                |
| Mattermost handles  | Required for communication | Not applicable              |
| Committer-of-Record | Separate trailer           | Supervisor line             |
| Quality indicators  | Emojis (📊, 🛡️, ⚡)        | Optional, plain text        |

The simple format is sufficient for community libraries where:

- Contributors use various AI tools
- No centralized agent infrastructure exists
- Traceability by model/interface is adequate
- A single noreply domain avoids spamming multiple providers

---

## Rationale

### Why require attribution?

1. **Debugging**: "This code has a subtle bug" → check which model generated it
2. **Learning**: Track which interfaces/models work well for which tasks
3. **Accountability**: Human supervisor is documented
4. **Transparency**: Users know AI was involved

### Why model + interface, not named agents?

1. **No infrastructure needed**: No MAINTAINERS.md agent definitions
2. **Works with any tool**: No special configuration required
3. **Neutral**: Any contributor can use any AI tool
4. **Sufficient granularity**: Model version captures capability differences

### Why unified noreply@3leaps.net?

1. **Avoid spam**: Provider noreply addresses (anthropic.com, openai.com) shouldn't receive accidental emails
2. **Consistency**: Same email regardless of AI provider or model
3. **Control**: Any accidental messages go to a known, controlled destination
4. **Simplicity**: One email to remember, not one per provider
